# passwrd

passwrd is a Python script that generates a random, secure password for online user accounts. passwrd currently offers two options:

1. Generate a password by hashing a given phrase
   - One way to generate a memorable, yet secure password, is to hash a memorable quote or phrase. This can be followed by random combinations of numbers and special characters.
   - For example: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog --> !42tqbFjOTLD:
2. Generate a completely arbitrary password
   - A completely random string of letters, digits, and special characters is very secure. Although, these types of passwords are usually harder to memorize.
   - For example: Y2?{f\*0&nbsp;
